### Customer Segmentation

Any company who sells products or services can benefit by segmenting their customer base. Knowing your audience is the first step in helping to sell your products and/or services successfully. Segmentation is an organizational strategy that companies use to break down their audience into smaller, more manageable groups. Customizing these groups based on similarities – such as by demographics, location, behaviors or by interests - helps to create an overall better customer experience that leads to loyalty, brand recognition and ultimately higher profits. This project will specifically be focused on customer segmentation within the retail industry.

This data set is relatively small consisting of 200 customers. It was created for a Kaggle competition to help learn about customer segmentation. The idea is that basic data was collected for mall shoppers through the use of their membership cards. The goal is to analyze the variables (Gender, Age, Annual Income and Spending Score) to determine marketing strategies moving forward. Specifically, the following questions will be addressed:

1. Are there customers with similar spending patterns?
2. Does age, gender and/or income affect a customer’s spending score?
3. Can we determine which cluster/group of customers are not so valuable, valuable, and very valuable? (rank)
4. Based on the clusters found, what are the next steps for targeting each group?
5. Can a customer shift to a different cluster if their spending score changes?
